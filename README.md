## ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS

Originally just a **Rock-Paper-Scissors** project to be run from browser console. 

Now a webpage with UI n buttons n stuff.   

Built for practicing DOM manipulation as part of [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.  

Currenty barebones and ugly. But hey, it works.  

To be heavily refactored in near future - yo boi got some ideas.   

### Stuff to add: 

- replace score numbers with * (of another mark symbol) to be appended for each victory.  
  Example:  
  **Now:**  
   ```
  Player: 5
  Computer: 3
   ```
  **Updated:**
  ```
  Player | Computer
  *****  | ***
  ```
  ...or something similar.  
  I can make the number themselves flash on score change as well, something to consider I guess.  
  The goal is to make score change more visually apparent for the player.
  
- make a simple graphical representation of selected hands for each round played. To be displayed in the `<div>` between buttons and result-container 
  
- make borders of pressed button and results-container flash green (on user win), yellow (on draw) or red (on computer win) depending on result of the round
  
- think of some way to make the 'draw' result more visually apparent to the player. Right now contiguous draws make it look like nothing happens. More visual clues needed.

- add basic info on how the game is player, number of rounds, ui controls to header and footer

- unwind the spaggetti code from the single file into a proper module system with imports/exports (yes I will do it last to never do it again)

- ...

- GLORY TO  ODIN
