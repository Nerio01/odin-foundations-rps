## ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS

Originally just a **Rock-Paper-Scissors** project to be run from browser console. 

Now a webpage with UI n buttons n stuff.   

Built for practicing DOM manipulation as part of [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.  

### Stuff to add: 

- unwind the spaggetti code from the single file into a proper module system with imports/exports (yes I will do it last to never do it again)

- ...

- GLORY TO  ODIN
