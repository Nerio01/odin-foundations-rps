Originally just a **Rock-Paper-Scissors** project for browser console, now its a webpage with UI and buttons n stuff.   

Built for practicing DOM manipulation as part of [The Odin Project]('theodinproject.com') curriculum.  

Currenty barebones and ugly. But hey, it works.  

To be heavily refactored in near future - yo boi got some ideas.
