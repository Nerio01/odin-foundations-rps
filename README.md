Originally just a **Rock-Paper-Scissors** project to be run from browser console. 

Now a webpage with UI n buttons n stuff.   

Built for practicing DOM manipulation as part of [The Odin Project](theodinproject.com) curriculum.  

Currenty barebones and ugly. But hey, it works.  

To be heavily refactored in near future - yo boi got some ideas.
